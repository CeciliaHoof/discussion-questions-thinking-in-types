# Discussion Questions: Thinking in Types

## Objectives

- Recall the datatypes in JavaScript
- Identify the types of different data
- Identify the types of input and output of functions and operators

## Introduction

JavaScript is a "loosely typed" language, meaning that you don't have to declare the type of a variable when you create it. This dynamicism makes JavaScript quite flexible, but it can make it difficult to understand what types of data are being used in a program. However, understanding the types of data is crucial to understanding how a program works. As developers, we should strive to always be aware of the types of data we are working with; cultivating this habit will avoid many bugs and make our code easier to understand.
