## Operators as 'Functions'

You can think of many operators as if they were functions. They take in inputs
and evaluate to an output.

### For the following operators, fill in the types of the inputs and outputs. Following the example, try to write out a function signature, as if the operator was a function. 
For more examples of function signatures, see the previous exercise.


| Operator   | types of inputs  | type of output | function signature                       |
| ---------- | ---------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| \*         | _number, number_ | _number_       | _multiply(a: number, b: number): number_ |
| + (string) |                  |                |                                          |
| + (number) |                  |                |                                          |
| -          |                  |                |                                          |
| \*\*       |                  |                |                                          |
| \|\|       |                  |                |                                          |
| &&         |                  |                |                                          |
| ^ (bonus)  |                  |                |                                          |
